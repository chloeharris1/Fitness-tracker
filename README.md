## Description
This is a Workout Tracker application where users can view, create and track daily workouts. Users are able to log multiple exercises in a workout on a given day and track the name, type, weight, sets, reps, and duration of exercise. If the exercise is a cardio exercise, the user can track their distance traveled.
